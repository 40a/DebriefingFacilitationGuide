# Conclusion

At Etsy, we believe that when failures happen, we have a simple choice to make:

- Do we want to react to this failure from a place of hindsight and judgment of
	people’s actions and decisions taken out of context?
- Or do we want to truly learn from the event by giving voice to the diverse
	perspectives and stories of the people closest to the work?

It should be obvious at this point, but we choose the latter option.

We hope this guide can help you develop the capacity to support that choice in
your organization too. By doing so, you’ll build a container for learning that
enables people to bear witness to the complexity of the work being done around
them every single day. By making the effort to facilitate effective
debriefings, you are providing countless, invaluable opportunities to learn and
develop expertise within your organization. Thank you for making that effort.
