=========================================================================================================

*“The purpose of an investigation is to understand how things usually go
right as a basis for explaining how things occasionally go wrong.” -
Erik Hollnagel, Safety-I and Safety-II*

Most traditional accident investigations tend to focus on discovering
things around an event that never actually happened. In an attempt to
prevent future accidents, there is an underlying assumption (Shorrock,
2014) for this somewhat peculiar emphasis, which is:

> *Someone did not do something they should have, according to someone
> else. *

Through this lens, what generally surfaces in investigations are
“findings” about what people did **not** do (pay attention, make the
right decision, etc.) rather than what they actually did. Without anyone
really noticing, these items get labeled as “human error” and through a
seductive and convenient contortion of logic, an event that never
actually happened is deemed after the fact as the “cause” of the
accident. Perhaps unsurprisingly, this results in an obvious
recommendation for the future:

> *Next time, do what you should.*

Unfortunately, this approach does not result in the safer and improved
future we want.

The perspective now known as the “New View” on accidents and mistakes
flips this thinking around, providing a different path to improvement
and learning (Dekker, 2002). We wholeheartedly believe in this approach
at Etsy. We’ve invested in operationalizing it on an organizational
level (Allspaw, 2010) and have shared our perspective publicly:

> “Adaptability and learning. We learn through honest, blameless
> reflection on lessons and surprises. We believe that traditional
> root-cause analysis makes learning from mistakes difficult. Our
> blameless post-mortem process is a widely-cited technique that we
> believe is becoming best practice among organizations that value
> innovation. Blameless post-mortems drive a significant percentage of
> our development as we analyze what about our production environment
> was less than optimal and rapidly make corresponding adjustments.”
> (Etsy, Inc., 2015)

How a postmortem[^1] debriefing (hereafter “debriefing”) is done (in
whatever form it takes) is at the core of the approach, and therefore
hinges on the expertise of the debriefing facilitator. Over the years,
we have developed an internal course at Etsy focused on building a
strong bench of debriefing facilitators. At the time of writing, this
course is comprised of:

> • Three seminars covering the theoretical and empirical foundations of
> accident models, historical case studies, topics of “Just Culture” and
> Safety-I/II (with readings and written exercises)
>
> • An interactive workshop for facilitators to practice core skills
>
> • Shadowing and feedback for new facilitators
>
> • Regular follow-up discussion groups

This guide is intended to be a lightweight set of techniques and tactics
distilled from the full course, designed to help facilitators develop
and sharpen their debriefing facilitation skills.

What brought us to write this
-----------------------------

Modern businesses critically rely on software, and that reliance will
continue to grow more critical. This is not a revelation. We believe,
along with a growing number of organizations, that the current and
prevailing paradigm of accident investigation in software-rich
environments is fundamentally flawed, confused, and dangerous in the
long term.

In Etsy’s corner of Internet commerce and marketplaces, we believe that
we can contribute to an emerging dialogue about what “safety” is really
made of: the presence of people’s expertise, not simply the absence of
accidents.

We first began practicing and developing expertise in facilitating
debriefs within the Engineering group at Etsy. Over the years, as we
have evolved our understanding of this work and its value, the greater
organization (beyond the technical side) became interested in this new
source of learning. As a result, we have adapted what was originally
custom-made for an engineering audience to be a more generalized and
accessible set of materials. We think this has been successful; to date,
more non-engineers than engineers have taken the course at Etsy, and
some of the most insightful debriefings have been facilitated by
non-engineers.

After four years of developing and evolving the internal course, we
considered that other organizations might benefit from what we’ve put
together. While we have attempted to make the material as generalizable
as possible, we must acknowledge that it has been developed on the job
and we are a company that operates an online business, which influences
what we have produced here. Nevertheless, we do very much hope that
other organizations (online and offline) find it useful.

Who this guide is for
---------------------

This guide is intended to serve as a starting point for debriefing
facilitators in organizations that rely on the successful design and
operation of software. It has been written with the assumption that
multiple non-technical stakeholders are involved in the dialogue around
understanding and improving the use of tools, processes, and practices
in the organization.

Influences and inspiration
--------------------------

As the original Code As Craft blog post (Allspaw, 2012) reveals, we have
come to these ideas, concepts, practices, and techniques through the
expertise and assets of the psychology, cognitive systems engineering,
and safety science communities. The text that we use in the internal
course is *The Field Guide to Understanding Human Error* by Sidney
Dekker. We reference a number of passages in these texts as well:

-   *Behind Human Error*, by David Woods, Sidney Dekker, Richard Cook,
    > Leila Johannesen, and Nadine Sarter

-   *Pre-Accident Investigations: An Introduction to Organizational
    > Safety*, by Todd Conklin

-   *Safety Differently*, by Sidney Dekker

-   *Engineering a Safer World*, by Nancy Leveson

-   *Safety-I and Safety-II: The Past and Future of Safety Management*,
    > by Erik Hollnagel

-   *Normal Accidents: Living with High-Risk Technologies*, by Charles
    > Perrow

-   *The Challenger Launch Decision*, by Diane Vaughan

-   *Working Minds: A Practitioner's Guide to Cognitive Task Analysis,*
    > by Beth Crandall, Gary Klein, and Robert Hoffman

Many of the techniques and approaches to interviewing and debriefing
facilitation in this guide can be seen as a specific translation of the
*Critical Decision Method,* which is a cognitive task analysis method
designed to draw out how people make decisions, pick up and understand
cues in their environment, and judge whether their actions are likely to
be fruitful or not. Essentially, it’s a semi-structured interview
approach using targeted questions focusing on decision making and
cognition with people trying to solve problems. Scenarios are broken
down into critical junctures, and we ask questions about those.
Developed by Gary Klein and his colleagues in the late 1980s, we have
found it to be an invaluable foundation for facilitators when they
approach a debriefing.

Why we focus on facilitation skills
-----------------------------------

**Because there are stories to uncover**

A key idea in the ‘New View’ perspective is that people’s actions and
decisions make sense to them at the time, given their experience and
familiarity with their tools, and their understanding of the current
situation.

The facilitator’s job is not to discover the things that people *didn’t*
do, but what they actually *did*, and how they perceived their world at
the time.

Productive debriefing facilitation is about getting people to tell their
stories. A facilitator does this by asking pointed, open-ended questions
that help to draw out descriptive details from people that they might
not otherwise say out loud. The debriefing exists to hear (and ask
about) people’s *descriptions*, not their *explanations*.

In other words: As facilitators, we are not looking for causes.

Finding cause is easy, and we don’t need a group interview to find it.
In contrast, finding all the things people actively do to keep the
system running effectively is quite difficult, so an accident provides a
unique opportunity for these underlying factors to be revealed.

**Because each story is essential**

Like the parable of the blind men and the elephant (see sidebar below)
there is no singular, omniscient perspective on an event involving work
in complex systems. There are only multiple perspectives, sometimes
overlapping and sometimes not.

  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **The parable of the blind men and the elephant**

  *Six blind men were asked to determine what an elephant looked like by feeling different parts of the elephant's body. The blind man who feels a leg says the elephant is like a pillar; the one who feels the tail says the elephant is like a rope; the one who feels the trunk says the elephant is like a tree branch; the one who feels the ear says the elephant is like a hand fan; the one who feels the belly says the elephant is like a wall; and the one who feels the tusk says the elephant is like a solid pipe. *

  None of them is wrong, but at the same time, none of the descriptions alone are sufficient to describe an elephant holistically.
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

For example: In an outage or otherwise surprising scenario, it’s clear
that a network engineer will likely have a different view of the event
than an engineer familiar with the application code, a database
engineer, a customer support agent, a product manager, a security
engineer…the list could go on. The facilitator’s challenge is to gather
these diverse perspectives and construct an aggregate narrative of how
an event unfolded.

Potential diagram:![](media/image01.jpg){width="5.046875546806649in"
height="3.7851563867016624in"}

That being said, our goal as facilitators is not to consolidate
different accounts into a unified story of cause and effect.

It’s very tempting (and quite easy) to take the perspectives that people
provide in a debriefing to create a singular, omniscient, and
comprehensive view of the accident, which we can (from our comfortable
and hindsight-driven seats) use to reveal precisely where people went
wrong. However, even if such an account could be constructed, it would
be an inherently inaccurate reflection of the complex realities in which
the people existed at the time, and will continue to find themselves in
as work continues and new incidents take place.

As facilitators, we are not looking to somehow merge these multiple
perspectives into a single story. Quite the contrary—the value in
gathering multiple narratives is to ask questions that shed light on the
contrasting and complementing parts of the different accounts shared in
the debriefing.

**Because everyone truly is an expert**

When we ask people for descriptions of their work, we hear about their
*expertise.* We hear about the tips and tricks they’ve developed over
their careers, like the shortcut shell aliases, special bookmarks,
one-liner scripts, and the go-to graphs they always look at when
diagnosing certain problems.

We hear about the procedures they always follow, and the ones they
sometimes skip because if they followed them blindly and to the letter
they’d have a bad day, guaranteed. We hear about what they *usually do*
when that alert goes off and everything is fine again. When “this” and
“that” happens, they do “these things,” but only in certain
circumstances. We coax out the hidden nuances underlying their actions,
decisions, and rationales.

A debriefing is where you learn how the mechanic can just lift the hood
of the car, listen to that faint hum of the engine, and intuit that it
needs new valves.

A debriefing is where you discover what makes their work difficult, and
what makes them good at it, despite the difficulty.

The benefit to others: vicarious experiences
--------------------------------------------

Expertise develops in large part from having a diverse knowledge-base to
lean on when trying to solve problems under time pressure (such as
diagnosing and resolving an outage). In our domain, this means that part
of getting good at handling incidents that have a high degree of
uncertainty depends largely on how many different types of incidents
you’ve been exposed to in your career.

One way to accelerate or augment training is through what Gary Klein and
Robert Hoffman called “vicarious experiences”—the shared and explored
stories of perspectives (Klein, G. & Hoffman, 1993). When we’re
facilitating a debriefing, one of the primary benefits is the emergence
of these “thick” descriptions, which provide a rich source of learning
for others in the company, and can help fill a gap in their training
that can’t otherwise be filled.

We know this to be true, as “war stories” told at conferences or in the
hallways of successful companies are always very compelling. The sharing
of these stories is critically important, and we tend to remember them
quite well.

What Klein and Hoffman (and others) strongly suggest is that these
descriptions *in and of themselves* can serve as training materials for
staff, which means that debriefing documents should be made available,
searchable, and shareable.

The question then becomes: How does a facilitator get good at eliciting
these descriptions?

The goal is to learn, not to produce remediation items
------------------------------------------------------

*“The problem comes when the pressure to fix outweighs the pressure to
learn.” - Todd Conklin, Pre-Accident Investigations*

When we ask software engineers to think about how to make their
environment "safer", we cannot be surprised that their response is to
adapt existing software, or build new software.

In some cases, this can indeed help, but employees should capture the
rationale for it and validate when it’s a constructive thing to do,
while being open to the idea that it might not be.

Our experience at Etsy is that identifying new tools (or modifying
existing ones) to “fill in the gaps” is one of the *many* outcomes from
a debriefing, and perhaps not always the most important one.

In particular, it’s important to be wary of the “dashboard trap”, where
the outcome of your debriefing simply adds another graph to an
ever-increasing number of graphs on yet another dashboard someone needs
to check before they can feel confident about taking an action, like
pushing code. The introduction of more input on a dashboard will
ultimately make it difficult for people to discern signals from noise
(making their jobs harder), so this is an example of a superficial
solution. If you find yourself falling into the dashboard trap, take it
as a sign that now’s the time to dig deeper.

The goal of a debriefing is not to produce recommendations or
remediation items. Yes, you read that right. As we mentioned before,
**the goal is not to find the cause of an accident**. The goal is to
seize the opportunity for an organization to learn as much as they can,
in a relatively short period of time, about how people normally perceive
and perform their work. Because the people involved were doing their
normal work on a normal day when the event in question happened.

To reach these learnings we ask questions that allow us to understand
the myriad ways the organization *prevents* this sort of event from
happening all the time, not by asking what made the event happen this
one time. That prevention is taking place, even if we’re not aware of
it. But we should be.

<span id="_huq774yms7ac" class="anchor"><span id="plaue3dtztyw" class="anchor"></span></span>Structure and Preparation
======================================================================================================================

We believe that organizational learning from accidents comes from
gathering data about the accident, constructing a timeline, and bringing
people involved into a group discussion led by a skilled and neutral
facilitator. While it’s tempting to simply send a form for people to
fill out over email, we’ve found that approach to be void of the context
and dialogue necessary for real improvement. It’s important to gather in
a room together and make the learning dynamic, rather than static.

That being said, there are a few key elements of structuring and
preparing for your debriefing.

Familiarize yourself with the timeline in advance
-------------------------------------------------

Before the debriefing, facilitators need to get a sense of the flow of
events, without forming opinions about what happened. You’ll want to
gather whatever *objective data*[^2] is available and construct a
timeline of events.

The initial timeline should be created by the people closest to the
event. Generally, they are responsible for coming up with the basic
structure of a timeline, which helps determine the boundaries of the
event being discussed. You’ll want to review this document to get an
initial idea of where the interesting communication patterns, decision
points, observations, and actions occurred so you can sketch out where
to dive deeper in your debrief.

Prepping is mostly about setting yourself up to best manage your focus
and the group’s mental cycles during the debriefing itself. A big part
of this is being keenly aware of how meeting time is spent. **The time
set aside for the debriefing meeting will always be arbitrary and it
will never be enough to cover everything.** Learning can always go on
forever! Reading through the initial timeline beforehand will let you
structure the meeting and guide the discussion in a way that ensures
you’ll get through everything.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  **Some logistical suggestions to set you up for success as a facilitator**
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  -   Don’t facilitate alone. Ideally, you’ll have a co-facilitator to shadow and support you during the debriefing, and to give you feedback after it.

  -   The facilitator should not be someone who was directly involved in the event. If you were close, or even on the periphery, of what happened, you should ask a neutral, outside party to facilitate.

  -   Find someone (in advance) to be a dedicated note-taker for the debrief.

  -   Make sure to invite everyone mentioned in the timeline to the debriefing. Ideally, any team mentioned would have at least one representative attend as well.

  -   Scope out the logistics of the room beforehand. Is it big enough for everyone? Is anyone dialing in? Prepare yourself and the space (video equipment, chair layout, etc.) accordingly.

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unearth more objective and subjective data
------------------------------------------

The timeline provides widely accepted observations to use as a
“skeleton” for the debriefing. Data such as chat transcripts capturing
the dialogue between people attempting to coordinate and respond to an
event, dashboards, graphs or logs that people observed, the timestamped
actions people took during the event, etc., are all examples of
artifacts that can help construct the timeline.

As the debriefing progresses, you’ll use the timeline and the artifacts
within it to develop questions to ask. We’ll talk more about these
questions in the next section, but they represent prompts to gather
*subjective* data that build context around the actions and decisions
that took place. The subjective data are the opinions, judgments,
assumptions, beliefs, and individual statements that will come to light
during the debriefing.

The key idea is that when somebody says "X happened" you take the
opportunity to ask questions that provide context for X. Not everyone in
the discussion will come to the meeting knowing that context, so it's
important not to skip over details as you walk through the timeline in
the debriefing.

You’ll want to make sure that everyone involved in this incident,
especially representatives with diverse perspectives, are invited to the
debriefing and that you talk to key stakeholders in advance.

Whom you deem as "key" is specific to your organization. If you're not
sure, you should ask, because that is also useful data! The person who
requested or is organising the debrief is definitely key. The people
closest to the action in the incident are also key. Those folks also
know the most about what was really going on, and therefore might fear
being blamed for it, if they haven’t already blamed themselves. **Your
job as facilitator here is to make sure they feel safe sharing their
story.** You want to get a sense of what they're worried about, and what
they’d like to explore further, before you walk into the debriefing
together.

Talking to the people who would usually be blamed is really important
---------------------------------------------------------------------

It’s crucial to establish a sense of trust with all participants up
front. Find out if they've been to a debriefing before. Try to gauge how
much fear or anxiety they're feeling. You'll want to tread with more
sensitivity here. Some of this might feel like therapy, and that’s OK.
You want to set everyone up for success in the debriefing, which means
helping them feel at ease and reminding them that feeling anxious or
embarrassed is what makes them the best teachers for their coworkers,
who will almost certainly find themselves in similar situations in the
future.

Remind them that hindsight and all our after-the-fact knowledge of the
outcome is what makes their decisions or actions feel embarrassing.

Remind them that before the unexpected occurred, they were just doing
normal work on a normal day.

Come up with some initial questions
-----------------------------------

Think a little bit about the sorts of things you might want to talk
about (based on your reading of the timeline and your discussions with
those involved). Focus on *open* questions—ones that don’t have “yes” or
“no” answers. Make notes in the margin about what seem like important
pivot points in the timeline, and jot down questions that might draw out
additional context from people involved. Doing this in advance can help
you stay on track and attentive during the debriefing itself.

Documentation
-------------

One of the most important outcomes from any debriefing is the annotated
timeline of how the events during the incident happened, as agreed on by
everyone in the room. To this end, it is important to have a dedicated
note-taker. You as the facilitator will be plenty busy guiding the
discussion, digging deep on interesting events, and coming up with the
questions that get the room to understand what was really going on.

Etsy has created a tool called Morgue (Etsy, 2013) to aid us with the
documentation process. It's a simple web application that allows for
adding a lot of metadata about an incident, as well as a timeline, and
graphs, images, and chat logs related to what was going on. The format
that will work for you is largely dependent on what fits your
organization best. Wiki pages or Google docs can work just fine. Etsy's
debriefing documentation started as pages on our internal wiki, but over
time we built Morgue to better accommodate our unique needs. We even
built a “request a facilitator” button, and have added Google Calendar
integration so that scheduling the debriefing itself is part of the
tool’s workflow.

However you document the debriefing and related artifacts, it must be
available and accessible to everyone in the company. You need to make it
very clear before, during and after the facilitation that a debrief is a
collaborative process that benefits from everyone’s input.

*Note: Not every organization will be comfortable with open access to
debriefing data. While this document cannot cover the complex dynamics
of what constitutes a* *“Just Culture”*[^3]*, we believe this access is
critical to the process.*

Setting expectations
--------------------

In order to make sure everybody in the room understands the importance
and goals of a debrief, the introduction you give at the beginning of
the meeting is key.

You have the job of simultaneously setting the agenda for the next hour
or so, AND getting people in the mindset or learning, which means making
the atmosphere feel as safe and welcoming as possible. **One of the
hardest parts is making everybody understand that we are not coming
together to prevent a future event from happening.** The things you are
about to look into and find may very well happen again. Preventing the
future is not the goal—learning is. And to that end, learning needs to
be the focus of the whole debrief.

As mentioned before, there is a powerful tendency to try and find a
single simple solution that explains what happened. In the search for a
cause of an accident we do tend to, in the words of Nietzsche, stop by
‘the first interpretation that explains the unknown in familiar terms’
and ‘to use the feeling of pleasure … as our criterion for truth.’
(Hollnagel, 2009)

So as the facilitator, you need to counter this most human urge to find
a single explanation and single fix for the incident. You can do this by
giving a brief introduction in the debrief to remind participants what
you are all there for: a semi-structured group interview. Nothing more.

+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Your introduction is meant to set up the paradigm within which         |
| everyone will operate for the duration of the debrief. Here is some      |
| sample introduction language:**                                          |
|                                                                          |
| *“Who has never been to a debrief before? Welcome! As a quick reminder   |
| for those of you who have done this before, and as an introduction for   |
| anyone who is experiencing this for the first time...*                   |
|                                                                          |
| *The goal for our time together today is to recreate the event, talking  |
| through what happened for each person at each stage in order to create   |
| as robust a portrait as possible of what happened, and what the          |
| circumstances in play were at each juncture (when decisions were made,   |
| and actions were taken) that made it make sense for people to do what    |
| they did in the moment. If one of you gains an insight into the          |
| complexity of another person’s role, this was an hour well spent. *      |
|                                                                          |
| *\                                                                       |
| Throughout the duration of this debrief, we will all focus on being      |
| utterly blameless, to ourselves and to others. We will be focusing on    |
| the HOW of what happened, not the WHY.\                                  |
| *                                                                        |
|                                                                          |
| *I’m facilitating, which means I’ll be keeping track of time, making     |
| sure we get through the whole timeline, and asking a ton of questions.   |
| I’ve met with a few of you separately to build a basic timeline of       |
| events which will help me keep the discussion on track. I’d like to      |
| invite anyone else to ask questions as they arise, and chime in if you   |
| have more information or context to add at any time. I’ll be taking      |
| notes and fleshing out the timeline during this meeting and will share   |
| it and my notes with all of you afterward. Who has questions?”*          |
+==========================================================================+
+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Structure of the discussion
---------------------------

One of best ways to ensure that you are following a path of exploration
(instead of looking for a single fix) is sticking closely to the
timeline. This makes sure you get a representation of the past that
everyone in the room agrees is as close as possible to what really
happened. Any remediation items based on a less accurate version of how
things went down will be less effective or even obstructive.

Because reconstructing the timeline is your main task, you should focus
the majority of time in the debrief on doing just that, addressing
remediation items afterward. For a 60 minute meeting this can easily be
35–40 minutes of discussion.

There will be many people who suggest remediations or fixes before the
group has finished walking through the timeline. This is inevitable, but
these contributions are less effective during this part of the
debriefing. Your job as the facilitator is to encourage people to write
down any ideas for improvement (sometimes known as “remediations”) that
come up during the timeline reconstruction, so they can bring them up
later, after the timeline is complete. More often than not, the
unfolding of events in the timeline render those initial remediation
items moot when the full (or at least fuller) context becomes clear. So
let the room know there will be a time for remediation items and to hold
onto them until then.

After you have established the timeline, you want to make sure everybody
agrees that it is accurate and comprehensive. This means asking the room
what’s missing, if there’s anything you haven't talked about, or if
anything happened differently than described so far.

Your next step is to pivot the conversation toward what the group
learned from going through the timeline, and to discover more
perspectives that can clarify what’s been written down or add additional
context. This is also when you’d invite everyone in the room to start
thinking about the learning points from the event. These can include
recommendations for remediation items, but shouldn’t be limited to them.

When you begin discussing learning points, encourage everyone to speak
up if anything comes to mind and to not censor themselves. You want the
initial phase to be more of a brainstorm. Nothing more, nothing less.
Anything goes, because we are looking for improvements to the current
system, and trying to unearth innovative ways to underpin the learnings
from the meeting. However, you must resist the urge to turn them into
actionable tickets just yet. These learning points are likely to come
from all directions and appear haphazard. Some might be very specific,
others very broad, and some might apply to different systems altogether.

Ultimately, you want to create remediations that are [specific,
measurable, achievable, relevant and
time-bound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMART_criteria)[^4], but in
the final section of the debrief, you don’t want to dismiss any ideas
that don’t conform to that criteria right off the bat. Instead collect
all the ideas as a brainstorming list. Then choose a small set of people
from the meeting who were close to the incident and are familiar with
the systems mentioned, tasking them with taking the brainstorm list and
dwelling on it for a bit.

The idea behind dwelling on the recommendations for some time and
developing remediation items after the fact is to just be aware of them
as *suggestions* and keep them in the back of your mind to let them
marinate. Then two or so (work) days later, bring that group into a room
to discuss the viability of those remediation items. This way, what
results are tasks that are effective and logical and stand the test of
time, rather than action items created in a rush during the final
moments of the debrief. The idea here is to give everybody "soak time"
to process the ideas that were brought up. The effect of suddenly
realizing the solution to a problem while you are distracted doing
something completely unrelated is a well-documented phenomenon (Smith,
2016). Generally, insights appear when we aren’t forcing them and we’re
allowed to gain some perspective over the issue at hand. And this is how
you're going to make sure the remediation items that make it into the
ticket queue are effective.

You might also want to remind everyone involved that having remediation
items is not a requirement for a good debriefing. If what a group learns
during a debriefing results in new ideas on how to make mistakes and
accidents less likely, that’s great. However, our experience at Etsy
reveals that it can be easy to generate ideas for remediations in an
effort to satisfy the urge to “do something” in the wake of a painful
incident. But what’s often downplayed is how the recommended fix might
needlessly complicate, or even *increase,* the likelihood of new types
of accidents in the future.

<span id="_4xgxd016gvra" class="anchor"><span id="qgogikjem51k" class="anchor"></span></span>The Art of Asking Questions
========================================================================================================================

*“...and you better believe we’re going to look into it—and we’re gonna be hearing many stories. Not just the story you’re telling, but many stories.”*
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

(Orange Is the New Black, 2016)

Keep your ultimate goal in mind
-------------------------------

The day of the debriefing has arrived. There are probably a lot of
people in the room and countless thoughts swimming around in your head.

Once you welcome people into the room and set expectations about the
mindset they should be in for the duration of the meeting (blameless)
and the outcome they can expect to walk away with (learning), there’s
really only one thing for you to focus on: discovering the story behind
the story. That is your north star.

It’s all about the questions you ask
------------------------------------

So how do you make sure what needs to happen in the debriefing happens?
Here’s the secret: The power lies in the questions, not the answers.

You are like a traffic conductor, holding up a stop sign to things like
blame and judgment, while giving behaviors like genuine, thoughtful
inquiry and active listening the green light. Instead of traffic signs
or flares, however, your tools are the types of questions you ask, and
when you ask them.

As the facilitator, you have the obligation (and privilege) of
persistently advocating for widespread understanding. You are in a
leadership position of modeling a dynamic where mutual understanding is
ensured at every step of the way, and you won’t proceed until everyone
in the room is clear on what exactly is expected of them. This is a
fairly radical state of mind, because access to information tends to be
associated with hierarchical or organizational power. Make no mistake:
Leveling this playing field can be uncomfortable for people. The
questions you ask are the key to this leveling and to making people feel
at home while you are doing it.

Remember to look for descriptions, not explanations
---------------------------------------------------

As we’ve gotten more experienced with debriefings at Etsy, we’ve found
facilitators wanting even more guidance and practice with forming
questions. It has become clear that some questions are better than
others, and some questions are downright hazardous to the entire
process. One rule of thumb as you facilitate is to steer clear of asking
people “why” and substitute “how” instead. **Asking “how” enables us to
hear other people’s stories. Asking “why” creates a story of our own and
tends to elicit only the evidence that supports our story.**

Getting at the “how” and not the “why” of what happened will help you
create a picture of all the things that were happening around the
incident, as opposed to a fabricated cause and effect chain that gets
created after the fact by virtue of hindsight.

This simple substitution will help you discover descriptions instead of
explanations from participants. This is important because explanations
tend to be reductive or defensive and usually scare the learning away.
While they can be messy and involve confusion or incongruity,
descriptions are necessary for building the rich context for the event,
which is the reason why everyone is gathered together in the first
place.

In general, you want to ask questions that reveal:

-   Cues that lead people to make **observations**

-   Context for **assessments or judgments**

-   Rationales for **choices or decisions **

-   Things that people **know** (and might assume are common knowledge)

-   People’s **state of mind** at the time

-   **Mental models** for how things “should” work

-   Factors that led people to take a specific **action**

-   Signals that bring people to ask for **help**.

Here’s what this can look like:

Someone makes an **observation**\
*“It seemed a little off.”*

-   Ask about the ***cues*** they picked up.\
    > *What specifically made you think that it seemed off?\
    > What were you seeing/hearing/smelling at the time?\
    > *

Someone makes an **assessment or judgment** about now or the future\
“*It was broken.”*

-   Ask about ***how*** they arrived at that.\
    > *How could you tell?\
    > When did you first notice?\
    > What tipped you off?*

Someone explicitly made a **choice or decision**\
*“So I decided to page the person on-call”*

-   Ask about any ***options*** they considered.\
    > *What brought you to that decision?\
    > Have you ever done this in the past?\
    > Have you ever NOT made this decision in the past under similar
    > circumstances?*

Someone stated something they **know**\
“*I knew that I had to get it fixed before I left work for the day .”*

-   Ask them ***how*** they knew it.\
    > *How did you know? Was this something you had been told, or had
    > happened in the past? Have you seen other people stay late to fix
    > similar issues?”*

Someone mentions something about their **state of mind**

*“It was frustrating that I couldn’t find the password for the account”*

-   Ask them what other ***external factors*** were in play at the time\
    > *What else was going on to make you feel frustrated?\
    > When did you first notice feeling frustrated?*

Someone explains their **mental model** for how things usually happen

“*Usually when I press this button, the machine turns on”*

-   Ask them to talk about what ***normal work*** looks or feels like\
    > *“Do you always turn on the machine that way? What usually happens
    > next, or right before? Are there other ways to turn the machine
    > on?”*

Someone talks about an **action** they took

*“I pushed this bit of code that would take things offline while we
figured out a more long-term solution”*

-   Ask them about ***alternatives***\
    > “*Were there other courses of action available to you at the
    > time?”\
    > “What sorts of pressure were you under at this time?”\
    > *

Someone mentions asking for **help**

*“After about twenty minutes, I paged the database team….”*

-   Ask them about the point at which they decided to ask for help

> *“Was there something that brought you to page the team then,
> specifically?”*
>
> *“How did you know that was the team you needed to page? Is there some
> guide you use? Some rule of thumb?”*

Probe for the invisible parts of expertise
------------------------------------------

> *“Experts in making diagnoses are not necessarily experts in
> explaining their process of diagnosis.” (Michalski & Chilausky, 1980,
> p. 63)*

What people notice, investigate, focus on, dismiss, or discover before,
during, or even after an event is not always apparent to others, or even
themselves. They’ll make judgments about these things they notice: Is it
abnormal? Is it worth paying more attention to? Will it become more or
less important later? When it comes to reacting to the information they
take in, some of those reactions are part of their “muscle memory.”

In fact, a great deal of what comprises expertise is *tacit knowledge.*
Our role as facilitators is to help draw out whatever bits of this
“invisible” mental space as we can from participants.

A rich way of unearthing this tacit (or hidden) knowledge that people
have is to target their assumptions, expectations, and judgments with
your questions:

### How do they “see” typicality?

> When we find a point where people were surprised, we can try to
> understand what their expectations were before they encountered the
> surprise. This means we need to get at what “normal” looks like for
> them. Some questions that are useful here are:

-   “*How did you judge that this situation was ‘normal’? *

-   *“When did you first notice that things didn’t look right to you?”*

-   *“In your gut, did this feel just about right?”*

-   *“At this point, do you remember feeling confident about what was
    > happening?”*

### How do they “see” distinctions?

> Another hallmark of expertise also includes the ability to perceive
> specific differences in seemingly identical scenarios. When experts
> are looking through multiple sources of data (logs, graphs,
> observations relayed by their colleagues, etc.) they can sometimes see
> things that others might not. Questions that can be helpful in this
> vein are:

-   *“What was it about that metric that brought you to look closer at
    > the issue?”*

-   *“Is there something special about this error log that others might
    > not know?”*

-   *“What things do you look for when you suspect that this type of
    > failure mode is in play?”*

### How do they “see” the future unfolding?

> Another primary component of expertise is the ability to *mentally
> simulate* the state or picture of a changing process, and consider
> what pitfalls or opportunities might lie ahead. Some questions that
> can help people describe this might be:

-   *“Tell me how you think about which change to make when you see
    > these errors.”*

-   *“Did you ‘try out’ different options in your mind about what to do?
    > What were they?”*

-   *“Can you draw a diagram (hand them a dry-erase marker) about what
    > you remember thinking the system was doing, and what you thought
    > your options were to change it?”*

-   *“How do you anticipate if the situation is getting worse, requiring
    > you to take some action?”*

Ask dumb questions
------------------

When in doubt, or if you get lost, you can always ask dumb questions. In
fact, asking dumb questions is part of your job. You are in a unique
position of not risking ridicule by jumping in and asking someone to
explain what they mean by “database sharding” or “full stack.”

Plus, there is a huge side benefit of the dumb question tactic: It puts
the person doing the explaining into a position of showcasing their
expertise, which is a nice place to be. It also provides insight to the
entire group about the tacit knowledge wrapped up in something that we
might talk about or interact with all the time but have very different
ideas of what it actually means.

The art of debrief facilitation revolves around taking turns leading and
following what’s happening in the room. You are looking to create the
conditions that essentially transport people back in time so they can
speak honestly about what was going on inside and around them when they
did what they did.

> “The perspective from the inside of the tunnel. This is the point of
> view of people in the unfolding situation. To them, the outcome was
> not known (or they would have done something else). They contributed
> to the sequence of events because of what they saw on the inside of
> the unfolding situation. To understand ‘human error,’ you have to take
> this perspective.” (Dekker, 2014)

Your goal is to create a space for people to understand the incident
from a different perspective, and to gain a deeper understanding of how
other people do their work on account of the diverse contexts in which
we all operate.

For all the participants in the room listening, the sheer act of
witnessing these perspectives enables them to empathize, making them
better teammates and contributing to the wider organizational expertise.

When to dig in more
-------------------

One of the most challenging and nuanced components of debrief
facilitation is sorting out the narrative threads in a discussion and
determining which one to tug in order to help the whole story unravel.

\[KNOTTED THREAD ILLUSTRATION?\]

As the group walks through a timeline and questions are asked and
descriptions given, the facilitator has to decide when to go deeper into
a particular area (“zoom in”) and when to pull back to the greater
timeline context (“zoom out”).

A solid cue that digging deeper with questions might be valuable is when
a participant alludes to part of a description that they believe is
“common knowledge.” For example:

> *“…of course I didn’t want to pull it from the load balancer that way,
> obviously.”*

When you get an answer such as this, it’s a great signal to ask what
brings them to think the judgment they made was obvious. Gauge the rest
of the group:

> *“Is making this call not to pull it from the load balancer that way
> obvious to everyone?”*

Remember that our role as a facilitator is to get people to say things
out loud that they normally might not. If someone believes a decision to
be obvious, that’s a great opportunity to validate their belief with the
group.

You’ll also be presented with moments where it’s necessary to to the
opposite: to zoom out and ask about connections between perspectives.
This can happen when the discussion is veering too much into the weeds
and away from what you’ve identified as crucial points in the timeline.
In these instances it can be useful to ask people to step back from the
day-to-day and consider the hand-off moments, where work is transitioned
between people or teams and where the potential for misunderstanding is
high. You can do this by asking something like:

> *“How much of this is new information for people in the room?”*
>
> *“How many of you in the room were aware of all the moving pieces
> here?”*

Approaching your debriefing with a true “beginner’s mind” will enable
the people in the room with you to follow suit.

Make no mistake: Knowing when to “zoom in” or “zoom out” is challenging.
The good news is that it gets easier with practice.

How do you know if you’ve succeeded?
-------------------------------------

We have come to think about two very basic success metrics when it comes
to facilitating debriefings: the acquisition of new information that
affects future work; and attendees’ willingness to participate in future
debriefings.

In order to collect some sort of evidence of those metrics, we have put
the following thresholds in place:

1.  If just one person learns one thing they didn’t know before that
    > will affect how they work in the future

2.  And if at least half of the attendees say they would attend another
    > debrief in the future, then the facilitator can consider it a job
    > well done.

  **Pro Tip:** Pause at intervals during debrief discussions and ask people to raise their hands if they have learned something they didn’t know before. Invariably, hands will raise, eyes will look around, and heads will nod. This exercise can serve as proof positive that meaningful experiences are being had in the room.
  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two factors at play when it comes to creating widespread
perception that debriefings are time well spent. The first is the values
and culture of your organization, and the second is what happens in the
room. Perception of both factors is crucial, and as a facilitator you
have the power to affect them both with the questions you ask. You are
there to give the people doing the work a voice, but in order for them
to speak candidly, they have to feel safe—not just in the room, but in
the community. Fear of retribution or punishment (even the subtle social
kind) will silence participants. Without this[^5], it is nearly
impossible to have effective debriefings.

There is never one right question and your inquiry skills will develop
over time and with practice. It’s important to rely on what is at play
in the room (Are there confused looks? Was that an eyeroll?) as well as
your gut. As Klein says, “Curiosity should be your geiger counter.”

Conclusion
-----------

At Etsy we believe that when failures happen, we have a simple choice to
make:

-   Do we want to *react* to this failure from a place of hindsight and
    > judgment of people’s actions and decisions taken out of the
    > context?

-   Or do we want to truly *learn* from the event by giving voice to the
    > multiple diverse perspectives and stories from people who are
    > closest to the work?

It should be obvious at this point, but we choose the latter option.

We hope this guide can help you develop the capacity to support that
choice in your organization too. By doing so, you’ll build a container
for learning that enables people to bear witness to the complexity of
the work being done around them, every single day. By making the effort
to facilitate effective debriefings, you are providing countless
invaluable opportunities to learn and develop expertise within your
organization. Thank you for making that effort.
