# Debriefing Facilitation Guide

In 2012, we wrote a post for the [Code As Craft blog][cac_post] about how we approach
learning from accidents and mistakes at Etsy. We wrote about the perspectives
and concepts behind what is known (in the world of Systems Safety and Human
Factors) as the New View on “human error.” We also wrote about what it means for
an organization to take a different approach, philosophically, to learn from
accidents, and that Etsy was such an organization.

This Debriefing Facilitation Guide is an attempt to complement this blog post
with a more practical guide about how we approach learning from incidents in
practice.

You can read more about the backstory [here][cac_post2] and guide is available
in [markdown][markdown_guide] or [PDF][pdf_guide].
